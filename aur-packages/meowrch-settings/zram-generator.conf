# Meowrch ZRAM Configuration
# Compressed swap in RAM for better performance

[zram0]
# Size of ZRAM device (equal to RAM size)
zram-size = ram

# Compression algorithm (zstd provides best compression ratio)
compression-algorithm = zstd

# Swap priority (higher than regular swap)
swap-priority = 100

# Filesystem type
fs-type = swap

# Optional: Set different size for systems with lots of RAM
# For systems with 16GB+ RAM, you might want to use:
# zram-size = ram / 2
